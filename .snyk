# Snyk Configuration
# This project is an OpenUSD/Omniverse digital twin project
# It does not contain standard package manager files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
# that Snyk can scan for vulnerabilities.
#
# This project uses USD files and Omniverse Kit templates.
# Dependency management is handled through Omniverse's packman system.
#
# For security scanning, please use Omniverse-specific tools:
# - Omniverse Launcher security checks
# - Packman dependency verification (./repo.sh verify)
# - Python extension scanning (pip-audit, safety, bandit)
# - USD file content review
# - NVIDIA Product Security Portal: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/security
#
# Note: Snyk will show an error because this project doesn't have standard
# dependency files. This is expected and can be safely ignored.
# See SNYK_NOTES.md (or SNYK_NOTES_EN.md) for detailed information.
